        been replaced with LaTeX macros, and wrapped in \text{}, but incorrectly.
        
        For example, \text{\^e} is used to produce the 'Ãª' character. The grouping
        is incorrect in this, as the character macro should have braces, and the
        \text command as well, ie. it should be \text{{\^e}}.

The emphasis is on computational efficiency suitable for real elections, and on very general ballot types.},
